# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

My sample, which includes both current and former entry- and lower-level employees, is designed to gather diverse perspectives. Current employees can share insights into ongoing issues, while former employees provide valuable feedback on the reasons for their departure. This combination strengthens the sample by addressing both present and past experiences.

I expect my sample to be somewhat representative of the target population, provided that I achieve a high response rate and include participants from various departments, roles, and tenure lengths. However, there are challenges that may affect representativeness. For example, selection bias could arise if former employees with negative experiences are less likely to respond, and non-response bias might occur if current employees hesitate to provide honest feedback due to fear of repercussions. Additionally, by focusing only on employees who left within the past three years, I may miss important trends from earlier periods.

In summary, while my sample has a strong design, its representativeness depends on addressing potential biases and ensuring balanced participation. To improve reliability, I could encourage participation from underrepresented groups and anonymize responses to foster honest and comprehensive feedback.


2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

I will make changes for the following survey questions:
    1. What were/are the main reasons for your dissatisfaction, if any?
    (Select all that apply: Compensation, Work-life Balance, Career Growth, Management Support, Team Dynamics, Workload, Company Culture, Other â€“ Please specify)

    New Change: Add an option: "None, I am/was satisfied with my role."
    Reason: This reduces error by capturing the perspective of employees who may not be dissatisfied.

    2. Did you feel there were sufficient opportunities for career growth and advancement in your role?
    (Yes, Somewhat, No)

    New Change: Add "Not Applicable" as an option.
    Reason: This ensures inclusivity for respondents whose roles may not have advancement opportunities, improving survey quality.

    3. How would you describe the company culture in terms of inclusivity, communication, and employee recognition?
    (Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative)

    New Change: Split this into three separate questions to address inclusivity, communication, and recognition individually.
    Reason: Separating these aspects reduces ambiguity and improves clarity.


3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

No, the purpose of my survey could not be fully achieved through an observational study. The survey aims to uncover the reasons behind employee turnover and identify actionable steps to improve satisfaction. Achieving this requires gathering subjective experiences, opinions, and feedback, which observational studies cannot provide.

Observational studies rely on analyzing patterns or behaviors without direct interaction. While such studies might reveal trends, like higher turnover rates in specific departments, they cannot explain the underlying reasons. For example, observing resignation patterns would not clarify whether employees are leaving due to poor management, lack of career growth, or issues with work-life balance.

In contrast, the survey engages employees directly, allowing them to express their thoughts on culture, workload, and career opportunities. This direct feedback is crucial for understanding specific concerns and making targeted improvements. While observational studies can complement the survey by identifying trends to investigate, they lack the depth needed to fully address the purpose of the survey.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.
